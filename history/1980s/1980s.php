                Electrode: coaxial, rectangular shape (the rectangle had such good proportion of the sides that is still
                copied in all devices). This device had one more type of electrodes — “paravertebral” — in the form of
                two plates made of stainless steel. At the same time they served as locks of the casing. Socket for
                remote electrode became smaller.

                Energy regulation: slide control, with “up” and “down” buttons. Two LEDs indicated energy and frequency.
                The frequency was set with digital binary code (like in ENS-02). Four different levels of “depth”. Time
                of stimulation and pause interval are also set with binary code, similarly to frequency.

                Power supply: silver-zinc galvanic cells from military satellite-born systems. They could supply power
                to the device during 10 years of home use.

                The most unique thing about this device is that it was assembled with three small-scale integration
                circuits — three inverters in one chip. And 96 diodes!

                The first device named SCENAR. It was developed for serial production at the “Priboy” factory (Taganrog).
                The casing was milled out of one solid piece of Plexiglas. The casing was 0.7–1.5&nbsp;mm thick and bent
                in the region of the electrode to make it more convenient to use. This was full imitation of molded
                plastic. In fact, this casing was much better than the real plastic one which would be made later.

            <p class="content-p">
                Electrode: coaxial, rectangular, with little “bumps” on the surface to provide better contact of the

                Digital multistep control of energy with “up” and “down” buttons. This device had only two frequencies
                of action which could be selected with the buttons. Two LEDs indicated energy level and frequency.

                Back in Krasnodar times Alexander Karasev started mountain climbing (the Caucasus was nearby). He could
                not pass over his fellow climbers. Frostbites, hypoxia, ultraviolet burns or any disease in the
                mountains can be a catastrophe. Specially for them, he made one and only device — SCENAR T4-01 “Lhotse”
                powered by solar battery. This is the first device which was taken to the mountains and was used
                during expedition to Lhotse (Nepal). Even the casing was made by Alexander Karasev himself on the
                milling machine.
