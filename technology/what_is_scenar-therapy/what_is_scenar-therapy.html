                Physiological basis of SCENAR-therapy
            </h2>
            <p class="content-p">
                One of the main principles of medicine that has been developed and studied for thousands of years is
                mobilization of body inherent reserves while using minimum medications.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Cutaneous integument of a living body is an information field accumulating data concerning condition
                of organs and tissues. The main peripheral informational element on the cutaneous integument is a
                biologically active point characterized by increased sensibility to any external action.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Due to correlation between cutaneous integuments, organs, and systems, their malfunctions manifest
                through skin. As a result, our skin functions as an information field accumulating data of the bad
                organs' condition.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Acting upon this information field (cutaneous integument) enables external influence upon the
                disordered organs and functional systems.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Present-day clinical observations prove that malfunction of a certain organ may be eliminated by the
                appropriate action upon the certain areas of the body.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                SCENAR-therapy is effectively applied for treatment of headaches (caused by brain vessels spasm,
                overstrain and contusion), nervous exhaustion, depression, pain syndromes of neurologic character,
                muscle spasms, initial stages of any inflammatory process, impotence caused by nervous exhaustion.
                These are conditions of functional disorders, i.&nbsp;e. disorders of functioning.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                SCENAR-therapy is not a panacea. Above all, its action is aimed at normalization of the disordered
                body functions, while providing harmony in the body and stimulation of its defense potentials.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Considered as a biological object, a human body is an organized complex of functionally related cells,
                tissues, organs and systems. Their correlation provides vital functions of the body under constantly
                modifying conditions.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                A human body may be considered as a system with a number of subordinate according to a certain
                hierarchy feedbacks. This system is half-open to external environment. The biological system is
                constantly exchanging its substance, energy and information with the external environment. Conditions
                of the environment are continuously changing, which may require maximum use of the adapting abilities
                of a human being.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                At the same time, a human body is a great information system. Every functional system of a living
                body — from central nervous system to cells and cell parts — is supplied with controlling, executive,
                and monitoring elements and feedback system.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Control of every system can be carried out by two ways: changing its structure or conditions of
                functioning. The first way is rather complicated. The second one, which suggests control of the systems,
                is carried out with SCENAR. This method is aimed at restoration of the optimal activity of cells,
                tissues, organs, and systems of the body. A living body reveals amazing potential during complicated
                processes of regulation. The success of regulation mostly depends on the cutaneous integument.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                For a long time skin has been considered as a regulator of various physiological functions. Irritating
                different reflexive areas it is possible to eliminate pain, cramps, increase or decrease metabolism,
                accelerate or decelerate cardiac rhythm.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Body reaction depends upon the irritated area, due to peculiarities of the nervous system adapting the
                body and its systems to the conditions of external environment. There are certain cutaneous integuments
                of increased physiological activity which are applied for treatment of various disorders by
                SCENAR-therapy methods.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                The most complicated engineering (like spaceship) is crammed with thousands of sensors and receptors
                controlling and monitoring units, modules, etc. Skin has much more sensors and receptors carrying
                minute data, concerning all the processes in the internals and their condition, and receiving important
                information from the environment.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Cutaneous integument indicates condition of the internals and regulation systems. After proper
                processing, this information gives a full picture of the processes occurring in the body.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                The cutaneous integument perceives external signals significant for vital activity of the body and
                control of malfunctions of the internal systems.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Changes in the body are possible on energy and information levels. The action can be conducted upon
                both the systems and their correlations.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                The method of acting with information is more accurate and universal since it promotes control of
                energy, humoral and other processes.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Skin has a unique ability to combine functions of a diverse sensor and a receptor for different by
                their physical nature signals. For example, the cutaneous integument perceives signals of such
                irritants as mechanical (acupuncture and massage) or thermal action, electric current, magnetic field,
                biological field, laser ray, or ultrasound.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                As a receptor, skin can perceive external information in the form of electric, optical, thermal,
                chemical, magnetic, mechanical and other signals, preprocess it, form appropriate coded signals, and
                transmit them into control systems of the human body.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                More significant for SCENAR-therapy are transmission of information in the form of electric signals
                (the quickest way) and transmission of the signals through membranes (which is a slower and less
                studied way).
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                The irritant is amazingly small, but its energy is unequal to the body response — organism total
                reaction, because while receiving information, the skin acts as an input circuit of hypersensitive
                power amplifier, i.&nbsp;e. a human body. As has been proved by physiologists, reticular formation
                in the centre of the brain, which is our energy centre, amplifies signals of any origin received
                by our body.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Input signal level is extremely small, but being a control signal, it causes significant energy
                changes in a human body which has its own power supplies (reticular formation).
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                It is known that malfunction of any organ causes change of conduction, capacity, and temperature
                of certain areas of the cutaneous integument. Increased skin sensitivity manifests in painful contact.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                This variability of signals at the input and output of cutaneous integument testifies to perfection
                of creations of nature. Now when information processing can be automated with computers, we can carry
                out profound study of a human body and create efficient medication-free methods of treatment.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                As a rule, biological processes are accompanied by electric currents of very low voltage. Thus, to
                act upon biological processes occurring in a human body, it would be expedient to apply electric
                signals in the form of microcurrents of low voltage, with parameters similar to the currents
                accompanying biological processes.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Electric current of microampere range provides reflexive action upon the central nervous system
                which enables influencing vital processes at the cell level by stimulation and inhibition, transferring
                charges or ions, and, sometimes, by destruction or creation of individual cell formations.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Such action can be put into practice by various devices providing low voltage direct current of
                microampere range and alternating current of certain frequency and intensity. In contrast to this,
                SCENAR-therapy acts upon the body with voltage pulses similar to biological ones. The action is
                focused on harmonization of body vital activity and stimulation of its defensive potential by
                invoking the idle body reserves.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                One should always bear in mind that our body is coded for maintaining its homeostasis, i.&nbsp;e.
                coordination of organs and systems. First of all, the method is effective for treatment of functional
                disorders.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                Amazing results of SCENAR-treatment of various acute and chronic conditions is hardly explainable from
                the scientific point of view. But the facts are stubborn things — patients do recover! This is
                obviously promoted by the following:

                other. Of course, a human body is a leader in this interaction, and SCENAR is a means executing the
                body commands and providing help. Such harmonious cooperation contributes to successful treatment of
