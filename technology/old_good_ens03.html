               One of the most frequent questions being asked is what the difference is between our treatment technologies
               which we have developed during several decades. Some years ago, we posted an article
            <nobr><a href="/ru/technology/tens_scenar_cosmodic.html">“TENS, SCENAR, COSMODIC technologies”</a></nobr>
            where we tried to tell about each technology, their development stages and further scenarios. Taking into
            account technological and development level of that time. However, nobody can know the future and only
            time will show what path the technology follows. Reading it today, we can see how much the things have
            changed since then... Now we have clear understanding of both capabilities of SCENAR technology and
            multiple feedbacks of COSMODIC technology. However, “active” technologies have been dramatically revised.

                SCENAR — a thing from the last century
            </h2>
            <p class="content-p">
                Yes, it is true, I have invented SCENAR last century! Indeed, it is a unique technology of treatment
                that has been serving human health and well-being for many decades already. But speaking seriously,
                it is quite old and for today, time of nanotechnologies, this method of treatment is rather rough.
                SCENAR is a method of “big stimulus”. The main criterion of the dose is absence of changes of skin
                impedance. Such approach of “big stimuli” is rather inaccurate and it causes adaptation in the body,
                which is not very beneficial for effect of treatment. Various methods of modulation, damping,
                frequency fluctuations and application of complicated protocols produce beneficial effect to some
                extent and support existence of this technology. On the other hand, all of it complicates
                implementation in mass use. However, for today SCENAR is the best pain-relief means.

            <p class="content-p">
                This technology was designed by “LET&nbsp;Medical” Research Lab in the beginning of our century.
                It was a serious step forward which could become possible due to implementation of multiple
                feedbacks. It was them that allowed splitting the “big stimulus” into several small ones. Transition
                from one small stimulus to another was now made on command of the body through the feedbacks.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                COSMODIC-therapy is definitely a therapy of new level with new possibilities. As promised, COSMODIC
                is just a beginning...

            </h2>
            <p class="content-p">
                Long ago, in 1976, I made a device called <a href="/history/1970s/#ens01">ENS-01</a>. 7 years later
                it was improved and upgraded to <a href="/history/1980s/#ens03">ENS-03</a>. Its design was as if
                introduced from space, even inner mounting resembled a big and complex, bulk and dense tangle, with
                complicated rules of mounting. High-density mounting was fantastic for those times and it was
                undescribable and could not be documented properly. Even its appearance — the device was made of a
                solid bar of black ebonite, without any fasteners — looked like a trimmed piece of meteorite. In
                spite of our poor and weak component supply base, this device had unique treatment features, which
                modern SCENAR devices still do not have.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                If one made an exact copy ENS-03, it would work. But it was impossible to make any changes in it,
                even shift something 1&nbsp;mm to the side. As I was already a lead engineer at Radioengineering
                Institute, for many years I had to rush from one factory to another, in hopes of introducing it
                into mass production, both on behalf of the Radioengineering Institute and on behalf of Research
                laboratory of medical electronics which I founded.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                All changes made for the device to correspond to the Unified System of Design Documentation, like
                <a href="/history/1990s/#scenar032">SCENAR-032</a>,
                <a href="/history/1980s/#scenar033">SCENAR-033</a> actually killed all therapeutic effect. And
                these devices just remained as samples in my museum. We could only achieve some success in the
                beginning of the 1990s, at the private enterprise, where we could neglect the rules and norms of
                the Unified System of Design Documentation. This is how
                <a href="/history/1990s/#scenar033">SCENAR-035</a> was born. It was a first serial production
                therapeutic device, produced by “LET&nbsp;Medical”, where SCENAR-technology was implemented.
                Today this technology still remains nearly unchanged, except for the component base. The method is
                good, but not as much as ENS-03.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                What was left off-screen is the high density mounting with invisible aerial spurious feedbacks,
                the instability of components which were thought to be the reason of allegedly “bad” characteristics
                of ENS-03 device, but which actually provided such dramatic treatment results. Replacing them with
                supermodern processors with quartz crystal control led to the loss of therapeutic effect. But this
                is only a clue to understanding of the fine-tuning and that any tiny change would turn the device
                into just a toy giving small electric shocks and something else.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                I have proved this in my other invention of that time, called “antiscenar”. At least this is how
                Alexander Revenko called it, as this device could disbalance the body within a few minutes. The
                point is that with the help of automatic electronic switching of the output stage, the body is
                being alternately affected by opposite polarity action in equal proportions. It is like turning
                on hot and cold water in equal proportions — it is expected to be warm, but the result we have
                got was rubbish and the body got very “upset”. Of course, we have never left it like this, but we
                designed SCENAR-033 device, which was intended to be put into production at “Priboy” plant in
                Taganrog. In this model it was possible to switch over the polarity manually when needed. Such
                approach provided big possibilities for SCENAR-033 and Dr.Revenko could prove it. We have produced
                20 test samples. But “Priboy” plant could never reiterate it in serial production. And in our next
                developments this technology was never implemented again, as the process of treatment required
                constant monitoring by the therapist during session. Devices with nearly automatic process of
                treatment required new, much “milder” methods of action, without provoking stress reactions, without
                “SCENAR-worsening” — these were methods of COSMODIC-therapy + sparse “informational” stimuli
                (opposite polarity).
            </p>
            <h2 class="content-h2-center">
                ENS — that which is!
            </h2>
            <p class="content-p">
                ENS-therapy is a logical continuation of COSMODIC-therapy in more advanced implementation. To put
                it simple, it is a big stimulus SCENAR + small stimuli of COSMODIC + “informational” stimuli. ENS
                technology is like Russian “matryoshka” dolls.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                To be able to understand how the “informational” stimuli work, imagine that you are driving on a
                mountain road and studs of safety fence, which border the precipice, flicker when you pass by.
                They are all alike and soon you even stop noticing them. But then someone has painted one of the
                studs in a different colour. While you pass it by, you will surely react and turn your head and
                get distracted from the dangerous, twisted and complicated mountain road — that’s how our body
                is arranged and that’s how it works inside too. The same way “informational” stimuli of
                ENS-technology work — during action the system inserts tagged impulses and waits for response
                (usually it is 0.5 to 4 seconds). According to the body response it corrects the next inserts.
                Inside these inserts there are more sparse inserts, etc, like in Russian “matryoshka” dolls.
                This way, we have an informational snowball effect. As all the inserts appear only in accordance
                with the body feedbacks, this “snowball” is actually synthesized by the body itself. After a
                definite time of action, our body starts using information accumulated in the “snowball” (which has
                been created through the feedbacks coming exactly from pathological focus) so intensively that it
                can activate its every cell in order to overcome the disease.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                In our old good ENS-03 failures occurred due to body response through spurious feedbacks, giving
                excess impulses (informational stimuli) at every burst of reaction, which finally led to such
                dramatic beneficial effect of treatment.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
                ENS-therapy based on informational stimuli allowed approaching informational space of the body even
                more accurately and getting resonance responses virtually from all body cells.
